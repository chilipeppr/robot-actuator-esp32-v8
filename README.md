# robot-actuator-esp32-v8
This is the repo for the robot actuator v8 based on an ESP32 as the brains of each robot arm actuator.

This repository contains the latest design for the small actuator including:
- PCB schematic and board file (Eagle)
- Bill of Materials
- Fusion 360 files
- STL files for 3D printing
- NodeMCU ESP32 for Lua firmware with touch module, pulse counter module, RMT TX module, and gpiomatrix module.
- Lua code for actuator
- Link to ChiliPeppr http://chilipeppr.com/arm workspace to control the actuator and to ChiliPeppr ESP32 for Lua workspace for uploading code to the ESP32 device http://chilipeppr.com/esp32
- Heat management test results
- Youtube videos

This actuator is based on the amazing design of Jeff Kerr's (LoboCNC on Thingiverse) 3D printed robot arm WE-R2.4 six axis robot arm. https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3327968

# Ordering PCBs

When ordering PCBs, keep in mind the thickness of the main PCB is 1.0 mm while the touch PCB is 1.2 mm. A white soldermask is recommended, but not important.

Main PCB is 1.0 mm thickness

Actually, I had to create my own right angle ones from straight ones to be long enough. They need to be about 10mm long from the touch PCB down to the pin headers, so buy the longest straight ones you can and bend them, then cut to size after you try to fit. Or, you can buy them from digikey.  |

|        | Higher end 35mm stepper Moon's                         |  $25.00  |  1         |  $25.00     | https://www.moonsindustries.com/p/35mm-permanent-magnet-stepper-motors/35pm048s8-08001-000004611120001819                                           | Not sure it's worth the money, but this motor is nice. I'm finding the cheaper motors are just about as good, but perhaps not as quiet or tight feeling as the Moon's.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
